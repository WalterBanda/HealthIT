# HealthIT Uonafya Projects

This monorepo consists of repositories and forks of the HealthIt project I am working on.

This projects help solve and improve health services across africa. You can learn and make an impact by contributing to this projects.

# Setup for Monorepo

The monorepo consists of submodules so a clone of the project won't cut it. You have to initialize the respective repositories {Clone the various repositories}.

To initialize the monorepo, run the following

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

This clones and does a checkout on the respective submodules.
